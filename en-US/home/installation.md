# Setup

Castro does not need a HTTP server, this means you dont need Apache, XAMPP, NGINX or anything like that. When you download Castro save it on any folder you wish and then start the application (.exe if using win) this will start the installation process.

# Installation

Castro comes with a very handy installation wizard. If its your first time using Castro start the application, Castro will tell you the running port of the installation wizard then just head over to that page and follow the simple steps.

During this process Castro executes your `engine/install.lua` file to set some custom values.
